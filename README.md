# About the course

Welcome to the University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming! This is an updated version of the popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.

The course does not require separate registration. You can simply dive into the first part of the course found over [here](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-1).
